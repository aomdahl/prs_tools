Things to add to:
calc_prs.py
    -Add reporting for subsets (how many at each threshold
    -Add argument to include only certain SNPs in the analysis (very simple, match by ID)
    -Figure out how to get it to run faster >_<
    - Do a shuffling to get a background PRS score, show if r2 is significant (?)
    -Find a way to not run plink2 so many times
    - Improve SNP reporting- count the number of non ## lines, not just numbewr of lines in pvar
    - Add minor allele frequency to default format
prs_asses_lowmem.R
    - Histogram of scores- are they normally distributed or not? (with clumping they ought to be by CLT)`   
    - Fix the distribution plots and get those running
COMPLETED:
Serialize outputs between steps for speed (may be a nice option, not needed)
Quantile plot (!)
Added memory allocation options
Validate clumping (possibly against PRSICE?) 
Implemented addition versus multiplication step in calculation
Removed forcing of bi-allelic snps, so only bi-allelic snps included.
Handling of missing genotype data
Resurrect Debug functionality (I want the gene lists again)
Speed up splitting
Remove bi-allelic SNPs (done in the summary stats data up front
Output of NAs removed
Total variants included from input SS file
(basically filtering out at each stage)
Number of people at each stage
Number of ambiguous variants excluded
Number of samples without phenotype.
